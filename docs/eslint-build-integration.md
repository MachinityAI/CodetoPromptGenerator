# ESLint Build Integration

## Overview
The build process now includes ESLint checking with strict enforcement before the Next.js build phase.

## Configuration Changes
- **Build Script**: `npm run build` now runs `npm run lint:strict` before building
- **Lint Strict**: New script `lint:strict` runs ESLint with `--max-warnings 0` flag

## Exit Code Behavior
- **Exit Code 0**: Build succeeds when no ESLint errors or warnings are present
- **Exit Code 1**: Build fails when:
  - Any ESLint errors are found
  - Any ESLint warnings are found (due to `--max-warnings 0`)

## Testing Process
1. Create a file with ESLint violations
2. Run `npm run build` - it will fail with exit code 1
3. Fix or remove the file with violations
4. Run `npm run build` again - it will proceed to Next.js build

## Current Status
The project currently has 18 ESLint errors and 14 warnings that need to be fixed before the build can succeed.
