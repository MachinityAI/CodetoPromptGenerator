## Key Features

- **Project Tree Navigation**  
  Select any local folder to scan and recursively build a tree of files and directories.  
  Exclude specific directories or file types with a simple UI.

- **File Selection & Token Counts**  
  Quickly toggle the files or folders you want to include in your prompt. The tool displays total token usage based on a naive word/punctuation count.

- **Meta Prompt Management**  
  Store and retrieve partial prompts (so-called "meta prompts") in a dedicated directory. Load or save these text files at any time.

- **Copy to Clipboard**  
  Gather your meta prompt, main instructions, plus the selected filesâ€™ contents in one click. Paste directly into your preferred LLM interface.

- **Python Backend for Extended Services**  
  An optional Python/Flask backend (e.g., for to-do items, scanning directory structure on certain OSes, or future expansions).
