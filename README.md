---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system.

1.  **Node.js v20+**:
    *   We strongly recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to manage Node.js versions.
    *   Install Node.js v20 or higher. The `.nvmrc` file in the repository will help you switch to the correct version automatically if you use `nvm`.

2.  **Python 3.9+**:
    *   Install from [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org). Ensure `python3` and `pip` are available in your PATH.

3.  **C/C++ Build Toolchain (Crucial for `tree-sitter`)**:
    *   **On macOS**: Install the Xcode Command Line Tools by running:
        ```bash
        xcode-select --install
        ```
    *   **On Debian/Ubuntu**: Install the `build-essential` package:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
        ```
    *   **On Windows**: Install the "Desktop development with C++" workload from the [Visual Studio Installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aytzey/CodetoPromptGenerator.git
cd CodetoPromptGenerator
```

### 2. Run the Setup Script (Recommended)
This is the easiest and most reliable way to get started. This script will:
- Use `nvm` to set the correct Node.js version.
- Install all Node.js dependencies.
- Set up the Python virtual environment and install all required packages.

```bash
bash .codex/setup.sh
```

### 3. Manual Installation (Alternative)
If you prefer to set up manually:

```bash
# 1. Set Node.js version (if using nvm)
nvm use

# 2. Install Node dependencies. This also runs a post-install script for Python.
npm install

# 3. If the post-install script fails, set up Python manually:
cd python_backend
python3 -m venv venv
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
```

### 4. Configure Ports (Optional)
By default, the Next.js dev server runs on port 3010 and the Flask backend on port 5010. You can customize this by editing the `ports.ini` file.

---

## Usage

### Development Mode (Recommended for most users)
To run the application with hot-reloading for both the frontend and the backend:

```bash
npm run electron:dev
```
This command concurrently starts:
- The Next.js development server.
- The cross-platform Flask development server.
- The Electron application, which loads the Next.js dev server URL.

### Production Mode (Local Simulation)
To test the application as it would be packaged (using the Gunicorn server on Linux/macOS):

```bash
npm run electron:prod:local
```

---

## Building for Production / Distribution

To create distributable packages for Linux, macOS, and Windows:

### 1. Build the Next.js Frontend
This step generates the static assets for your application into the `out/` directory.
```bash
npm run build
```
    
### 2. Package with Electron Builder
The following scripts use `electron-builder` to package your application. Artifacts will be placed in the `dist/` directory.

- **For Linux (.deb and .AppImage):**
  ```bash
  npm run electron:build:linux
  ```
- **To create an unpacked version for local testing:**
  ```bash
  npm run electron:pack
  ```
This will create an unpacked application in `dist/<platform>-unpacked/`.

---

## Testing

The project includes an autotest script to verify core backend and frontend functionality.

1. Start the application in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run electron:dev
   ```
2. Wait for both the frontend and backend to be ready.
3. In a separate terminal, run the tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
A summary of passed/failed tests will be printed.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **`tree-sitter` compilation errors on `npm install`**: This is almost always due to a missing C/C++ build toolchain. Please follow the instructions in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section for your operating system.
- **`EBADENGINE` or Node Version Errors**: You are running an unsupported version of Node.js. Please use `nvm` or install Node.js v20+.
- **Port Conflicts**: If default ports (3010, 5010) are in use, modify `ports.ini` and ensure your start scripts or manual commands reflect these changes.
- **CSS/JS Not Loading in Packaged App**: This is often due to incorrect asset paths. The current `next.config.js` with `assetPrefix: './'` should handle this for the `file://` protocol.

---

## MCP Server for Agentic AI

**NEW in v2.0!** This project now includes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables intelligent code context management for agentic AI systems like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible clients.

### What is MCP?

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is a standard protocol developed by Anthropic that allows AI assistants to securely access external tools and data sources. It's designed for modern agentic workflows where AI needs to interact with codebases intelligently.

### Features

üîç **Smart File Selection** - AI-powered relevance scoring for task-specific file selection
üìä **Code Graph Analysis** - Dependency mapping, import/export analysis, function/class detection
üîé **Codebase Search** - Text, regex, and semantic search capabilities
üå≥ **Project Structure** - Complete file tree with gitignore support
üìù **Git Context** - Recent commits, diffs, changed files, branch information

### Quick Start

1. **Build the MCP Server**
   ```bash
   cd mcp-server
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Configure Claude Desktop**

   Edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:

   **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

   Add this configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "codetoprompt": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": [
           "/absolute/path/to/CodetoPromptGenerator/mcp-server/dist/index.js"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop**

4. **Start Using!**

   Ask Claude things like:
   - "Use get_project_structure to show me the structure of /path/to/my/project"
   - "Use smart_file_selection to find files related to authentication"
   - "Use search_codebase to find all TODO comments"
   - "Use get_git_context to show what changed recently"

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_project_structure` | Get complete file/directory structure with metadata |
| `smart_file_selection` | AI-powered selection of relevant files for a task |
| `analyze_code_graph` | Extract dependencies, imports, exports, functions, classes |
| `search_codebase` | Search code with text, regex, or semantic matching |
| `get_git_context` | Get recent commits, diffs, and changed files |

### Why MCP Server?

Traditional approach: Copy entire codebase ‚Üí Waste tokens, hit context limits
**MCP approach**: AI selects only relevant context ‚Üí Efficient, scalable, intelligent

Perfect for:
- ü§ñ Agentic coding with Claude Desktop
- ‚ö° Code review and analysis
- üîç Bug investigation
- üìö Codebase exploration
- üöÄ Feature development
